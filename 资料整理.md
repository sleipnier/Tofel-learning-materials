### 教育
#### 专有名词
1. 单性别学校：single-sex school
2. 素质教育：quality education
3. 全面发展：all-round development
4. compulsory education 义务教育
#### punishments

1. According to the famous philosopher John Locke’s blank slate theory, we are all born to be like a blank sheet of paper without any marks or any thoughts. 
2. moderate punishments = decent punishments = **proper amount of penalties**
3. When kids have done something wrong or made a terrible mistake, the first thing that comes up in parents’ or teachers’ minds is a **fierce reprimand** or **voluble instruction**, which is quite easy for children to leave behind.
4. That’s why our country is supposed to **legislate, amend the laws, and establish penalties** to restrict the behavior of our citizens.
5. Once my parents or teachers have made the **punitive measures**(惩罚性措施) clear initially, I will never **have the guts** to violate them. 

#### 学生心理教育
1. The fact that you are all committing your valuable time to support Place2Be  and prioritise the mental health of your students is something that all parents should be grateful for.
2. These basic qualities are so much valuable than the always changing material and social concerns that can seem so important to young people.
3. It's our duty, as parents and as teachers, to give all children the space to build their emottional strength and provide a strong foundation for their future.
4. Of course, not all children have the **anchor**(支柱，靠山) of a strong family.
5. **juvenile = students = teenagers =  adolescent**

#### 多元化教育
1. Through learning a great variety of subjects, students can acquire general   knowledge across a wide range of fields. People should be well aware of the world, tending to be knowledgeable by studying a large number of disciplines. For example, I am not obsessed with all compulsory subjects, but I cherish the value of comprehensive education and study chemistry, biology, and physics diligently. Through attending multidisciplinary courses, I can develop my potential to understand the constitution of the world and the underlying principles of nature. Hence, accumulating general knowledge is part of a well-rounded education for
students, even if it is not essential for job hunting
2. Additionally, we must keep in mind that changing careers would be incredibly difficult for people with little or no experience in interdisciplinary studies.Without comprehensive knowledge, people would find it to be virtually impossible to quit a job readily and adapt to another new environment immediately.The examples are too numerous to count. **Jeff Bezos, a famous businessman who established Amazon which is one of the largest e-commerce platforms, and Elon Musk, an entrepreneur who created PayPal, X-Space, and Tesla Motors, have been known for their comprehensive achievements. Fortunately for them, through attending a wide variety of courses, they effectively identified and navigated their career transitions, achieving their career goals.** Therefore, learning in a multidisciplinary system in advance can offer people opportunities for career progression and transformation.
3. Last but not least, modern society has been increasingly emphasizing cooperation, which requires team members to grasp and master knowledge in multiple fi elds.People are benefi ting from collaboration because taking advantage of the talents and connections of various disciplines can help individuals tackle challenges effectively.For instance, the development of optical fi bers, which is entitled one of the most influential innovations in science, involved the fulfi llment of multidisciplinary coordination, including chemistry engineering, material science, and computer science. Interdisciplinary cooperation has helped engineers and scientists not only work creatively but also address problems in a pioneering and innovative manner. No doubt, mixed-ability general education can lay the foundation for improving crossdisciplinary cooperation in the long term
